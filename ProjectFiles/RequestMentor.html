    <h1>Request Mentor</h1>

    <textarea readonly="readonly" rows="10" name="RequestMentor" placeholder="Assuming that you have recently completed Green Belt Academics and are looking for an event to hone your newly acquired skills you will need to find a Black Belt mentor.  If your initial review of data collected points to continuing with this event, now is a good time to reach out and find a mentor to walk you through the process.  A mentor can look through the data with you and answer any questions you have about how to proceed.  A good place to start is contacting your GB Academics Instructor.  Another pool for CPI mentors is your local Manpower office.  If you are still having difficulty locating a mentor, use the AF CPI Portal to find a Black Belt practitioner near you."></textarea>
